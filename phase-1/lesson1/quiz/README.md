# Lesson 1 Quiz

Complete these exercises to test your understanding of basic Rust concepts. Create a new file called `answers.rs` in this directory with your solutions.

## Exercises

1. Variable Declaration
   - Declare an immutable variable named `greeting` with the value "Hello, Rust!"
   - Declare a mutable integer variable named `counter` with an initial value of 5
   - Try to modify `greeting` - what happens and why?

2. Type Inference vs Explicit Typing
   - Create a variable using type inference to store the number 42
   - Create the same variable but with explicit type annotation
   - What are the benefits of each approach?

3. Basic Operations
   - Create a mutable variable starting at 10
   - Increment it by 5
   - Multiply it by 2
   - Print the result using `println!`

4. String Formatting
   - Create two variables: your name and age
   - Use `println!` with the format string syntax to output: "My name is [name] and I am [age] years old"

## Bonus Challenge
Create a small program that:
1. Declares a temperature in Celsius (mutable)
2. Converts it to Fahrenheit using the formula: (C Ã— 9/5) + 32
3. Prints both temperatures with proper labels

Remember to use `cargo new` to create a new project for your answers if you want to run them!
